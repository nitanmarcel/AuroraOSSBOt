# AuroraOSSBot

Bot made for the AuroraOSS groups to help with managing suggestions, bug reports and more. Made in python using the telethon library.


## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):

Make sure you have python3.6 or above installed!


### Configuration

See `bot/config.py` to configure your bot.

Some of the configuration values are made specially for the AuroraOSS groups and you might need to omit some configuration values or you can also fork the source code and edit the `bot/__main__.py` file. Edit the 'bot/__main.py' only if you know what are you doing.

BE CAREFUL: This isn't ignored by the `.gitignore` file so you might leak your config by mistake. Make sure you delete sensitive info before pushing back to github or making pull requests.


### Python dependencies

Install the necessary python dependencies by moving to the project directory and running:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
